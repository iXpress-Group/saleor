cairocffi
=========

cairocffi is a `CFFI`_-based drop-in replacement for Pycairo_,
a set of Python bindings and object-oriented API for cairo_.
Cairo is a 2D vector graphics library with support for multiple backends
including image buffers, PNG, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output.

Additionally, the ``cairocffi.pixbuf`` module uses GDK-PixBuf_
to decode various image formats for use in cairo.
